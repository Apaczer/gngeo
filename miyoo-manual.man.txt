GNGEO : a Neo Geo AES/MVS emulator (without NG-CD support) based of MAME ROMsets.

BIOS: Default directory is /mnt/roms/NEOGEO/ for all bioses. 
    First of all the system will look for `neogeo.zip` archive,then it will try to locate `uni-bios.rom` in the same dir. 
    If both bioses are present you can't force uni-bios to be loaded, it shall defer to `neogeo.zip`.

CONFIGURATION :
    All configuration can be done in /mnt/.gngeo/gngeorc
    a sample file is provide : miyoo-sample_gngeorc
    Every option are also accessible on the command line.
    Per game configuration is also possible in /mnt/.gngeo/game.rc

    By default, gngeo search bios and games in
    /mnt/roms/NEOGEO/ (the game must be in a zip file, the bios not)
